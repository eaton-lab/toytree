"""Phylogenetic ANOVA

TODO
----
This module is intended for the development of phylogenetic generalized
least squares (PGLS) methods, including a phylogenetic ANOVA. Some
pseudo-code is written but this is IN DEVELOPMENT, and not yet 
intended for use.

    """Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

    ANOVA is typically used to test for differences in means across
    different groups or treatments. It compares the variance within
    groups to the variance between groups to determine if group means
    are significantly different. This method calls the scipy.stats 
    function `f_oneway` to run a one-way ANOVA.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values: Sequence[float]
        A Sequence (e.g., list, np.ndarray, pd.Series) of quantitative
        values to be analyzed.
    groups: Sequence[str]
        A Sequence (e.g., list, np.ndarray, pd.Series) of categorical
        group assignments for each value.

    -------

    """Generalized Least Squares...

    ANOVA is typically used to test for differences in means across
    different groups or treatments. It compares the variance within
    groups to the variance between groups to determine if group means
    are significantly different. When the groups are related by a
    phylogeny, it is necessary to control for the fact that some are
    expected to be more similar to each other than others. This is
    the goal of a phylogenetic ANOVA. 

    This method calls the scipy.stats 
    function `f_oneway` to run a one-way ANOVA.

    "How is the variation in a trait between different species 
    explained by their evolutionary history?"

    Look at that statistical significance of differences between groups.
    The null hypothesis is that there are no differences; the alternative
    hypothesis is that one or more groups differs from the others even
    after accounting for phylogeny. The key outputs are an F-statistic
    and p-value. The F-statistic measures variation _between-groups_ 
    relative to variation _within-groups_. Larger values indicates
    larger relative differences between groups. The p-value tests the
    null hypothesis that there is no difference.

def phylogenetic_generalized_least_squares(values: Sequence[float], groups: Sequence[float], tree: ToyTree) -> dict[str, float]:
    """Returns a ... result of a phylogenetic generalized least squares
    analysis.

    Generalized least squares is used to model data where the errors
    are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). GLS 
    allows for the modeling of heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) 
    and autocorrelation (dependence between error terms). When the
    values being modeled evolved on a phylogeny the variance-covariance
    matrix can be used to model the error structure.

    A GLS model accounts for phylogenetic non-independence by 
    incorporating the variance-covariance structure from the tree.

    This is an implementation in progress where we are trying to 
    implement PGLS using only scipy and not statsmodels.
