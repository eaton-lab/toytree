# Frequently Asked Questions


### How do I get help?
The first place to look for help or answers is in here in the documentation.
You can use the search bar in the navigation to search for terms or function
names. The next place is in the source documentation strings. Some of the 
source code is available here in the docs, but the rest can be accessed
in an interactive environment (e.g., jupyter) by executing a function name
followed by one or two question marks. The docstrings often contain detailed
descriptions of parameters and example usage. Finally, you can seek further
help or advice by raising an Issue on GitHub. To do this, navigate to 
https://github.com/eaton-lab/toytree/issues and click the green New Issue 
button in the upper right. Then click on Labels on the right to select 
"help wanted" or "question" as the category for your issue.
