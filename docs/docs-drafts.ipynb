    "    Bipartitions represent the splits in a tree. Many algorithms compare\n",
    "    tips (or internal Nodes) on either side of each split to compute\n",

    "    Notes\n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    - Bipartitions are generated in Node idx traversal order.\n",
    "    - Bipartitions are formatted as a tuple of two items, each of\n",
    "    which is referred to as a partition.\n",
    "    - The order of partitions, e.g. (part1, part2) can be toggled using\n",
    "    the argument `sort`.\n",
    "    - The type used to represent a partition can be toggled using the\n",
    "    argument `type`. Common formats are `set` or `tuple`.\n",
