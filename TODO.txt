----------------------------------------------------------------------

### tests
[ ] .color test_color_mapper funcs for feature vs values, and examples in scratch nb
[ ] .mod rooting test

### recent
[ ] .annotate: add a 'add_edge_lines' method.
[ ] .infer finish new implementation of consensus
[ ] .infer finish application of maxcut -- see external tools like MQLib.
```
t = toytree.rtree.rtree(8)
t.set_node_data("x", {i: {i.idx} for i in t}, inplace=True)
t.draw(node_colors="x", node_sizes=10, node_mask=False);
```
[ ] .draw embedding plot.
[ ] .draw | should we use aspect='fit-range'?; how can shrink apply to names here?
[ ] .draw allow setting edge_colors, widths, markers, labels, etc with Sequence of len=nedges or nedges + 1 or nedges + 2?
[ ] .mod allow rooting on a unary Node?
[ ] .data set_node_data (or heights mod) should ensure (float) type when setting _feature.
[ ] .io parse w/ .tree currently discards root dist. 
[ ] .core convert all NaN from numpy.nan to math.nan
[ ] .style/draw bug: draw(tip_labels_colors) parses nnodes instead of ntips values.
[ ] .distance treedist_quartets is soo slow for big trees... allow subsampling?
[ ] .mod clarify prune / drop_tips / extract_subtree / bisect
[ ] consensus allow diff numbers of tips (but require some kind of overlap?)
[ ] push textbook code to a branch.
[ ] .core check indexing w/ int-like for numpy 2.0
[ ] .consensus needs validating, including its effect on mean height/dist
[x] .annotate create simple docs
[ ] .annotate add colormap scale bar
[ ] .annotate add marker legend
[ ] .annotate edge/node labels allow using a value formatter {%.2f}.
[ ] .mod.root MAD is defaulting to inplace.
[ ] .mod set_edge_heights uses a tree copy and thus can't take Nodes as input currently. But this works in using set_node_data.
[ ] .draw italic tip labels are still broken.
[ ] .draw add edge_labels, edge_markers, etc., or just nodes_as_edges?
[ ] .data idea: allow setting a feature to None in set_node_data which removes feature from Node.
[ ] .color not possible to assign (x, x, x, 0.y) w/ y variable across nodes. Or is it easier to add node and edge opacity args?
[ ] .color want to be able to tab sample from .color.maps.[diverging,linear,categorical].{name}]
[ ] .rtree use \_tdiv instead of tdiv feature.
[ ] .container stroke
[ ] .mtree consensus supports ultrametric argument to set only dists based on mean heights.
[ ] .style set node_colors does not override node_style.fill.
[ ] .dist compute KC tree distances.
[ ] .mtree shared_axes still not aligning nticks among trees.
[ ] .mtree indexing does allow lists
[ ] .enum could be improved by using frozensets as default.
[ ] .set_node_heights option to min_dist and minimize conflict?
[ ] .mtree support write(nexus=True).
[ ] bug: `mtree[1].set_node_data("height", {mtree[1].treenode: 2}, inplace=True)` doesn't work. (int has no idx.)

### notes: places using variadic args
These two functions are the only that take \*Query as input.
- .get_mrca_node('r3', 'r4') --> ...
- .get_nodes('r3', 'r4') --> ...
Then, the rest of these take 'Query | List[Query]'
- .root('r3', 'r4') --> .root('~r[3,4]') or .root(['r3', 'r4'])
- .get_ancestors('r3', 'r4') --> .get_ancestors('~r[3,4]') or ...(['r3', 'r4'])
- .is_monophyletic('r3', 'r4') --> .is_monophyletic("~...") or ...(['r3', 'r4'])
- .get_node_mask('r3', 'r4', ...) --> ...
- .mod.extract_subtree(tree, ...)
- .mod.add_...

### "3.0.dev6"
[ ] .mtree i/o split on ; not ;\n. the newlines are not required.

are then .annotate, color, 

## later
[ ] refine the scale bar for unrooted layout.
[ ] allow for linear gradient on Any stroke by creating defs.

[ ] .annotate: add colormap scalebar (x, y, width, min, max, colormap, angle=0, stroke...)
[ ] .annotate: block shape as color gradient to groups of tip names.
[ ] .annotate: block color gradient as edges.
[ ] .annotate radial xshift should be interpreted as radial shift on c trees.

[ ] Tip labels SVG is not reducing CSS style for tip labels fill
[ ] .github actions to do conda-forge and pip install on version update push.
[ ] cleanup old files from repo
[ ] make contributor guidelines in docs (read toyplot's)
[ ] make advanced user section w/ Node modification section in docs

[ ] revisit 'alignment-baseline' as arg for node labels.
[ ] new validation should not allow setting substyle keys that aren't supported.
[ ] friendly float format support values

[ ] unittest search requires __init__ in all test dirs

## Annotation
[ ] store markers for legend


## Pushed to later updates
[ ] .io tree() args for U/R? (or auto-infer based on nan for last 1-2)?

[ ] Propose toyplot push to center title on axis domain instead of range or vice-versa
[ ] website blog
[ ] make example datasets in toytree.data
[ ] NodeQuery, NodeMrcaQuery, NodeMatch, NodeMatchType, Node
[ ] develop annotation edge marker for mapping mutations.
	- require the ToyTree Mark so that we know which edge_type arg was
	used to map positions correctly.
	- use this method in ipcoal for drawing mutations.
[ ] change `get_mrca_node` to `get_nodes_mrca`. Use a warning for a while to catch usage.
[ ] get_edge_data function
[ ] .partitions: allow user to select traversal strategy.
[ ] use scenegraph reorder from annotation.py
